The clipping operation (especially for lines and triangles) can be
quite expensive to perform in hardware. There are six clip planes of
the viewing volume that a primitive must be clipped against, as
shown in Figure 7-8. Primitives that are partially outside the near and
far planes go through the clipping operations. However, primitives
that are partially outside the x and y planes do not necessarily need
to be clipped. By rendering into a viewport that is bigger than
dimensions of viewport specified with glViewport, clipping in the x
and y planes becomes a scissoring operation. Scissoring is
implemented very efficiently by GPUs. This larger viewport region is
called the guard-band region. Although OpenGL ES does not allow an
application to specify a guard-band region, most if not all OpenGL ES
implementations implement a guard-band.
