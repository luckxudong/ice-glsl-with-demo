Non-Power-of-Two Textures

In OpenGL ES 2.0, textures can have non-power-of-two (npot) dimensions.
In other words, the width and height do not need to be a power of two.
However, OpenGL ES 2.0 does have a restriction on the wrap modes that
can be used if the texture dimensions are not power of two. That is, for npot
textures, the wrap mode can only be GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE and the minification
filter can only be GL_NEAREST or GL_LINEAR (in other words, not mipmapped).
The extension GL_OES_texture_npot relaxes these restrictions
and allows wrap modes of GL_REPEAT and GL_MIRRORED_REPEAT and also
allows npot textures to be mipmapped with the full set of minification
filters.
