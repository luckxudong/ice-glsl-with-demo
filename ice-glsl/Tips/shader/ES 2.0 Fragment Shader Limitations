ES 2.0 Fragment Shader Limitations

In Chapter 8, we provided a detailed review of the limitations on vertex
shaders and how to write portable shaders. If you need a refresher, review
that material, as almost all of the same limitations apply to fragment
shaders. The only difference in limitations for fragment shaders is that uniform
arrays can only be indexed with constant integral expressions. In the
vertex shader, it is required that all implementations support indexing of
uniform arrays using computed expressions. However, this is not the case
for the fragment shader. Indexing of uniforms using anything other than
constant integral expressions is not guaranteed to be supported by an ES 2.0
implementation.
