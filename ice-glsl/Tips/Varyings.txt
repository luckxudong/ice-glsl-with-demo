Varying variables are used to store the output of the
vertex shader and also the input of a fragment shader. Basically, each vertex
shader will output the data it needs to pass the fragment shader into one or
more varying variables.

These variables will then also be declared in the fragment shader (with matching types)

and will be linearly interpolated across the primitive during rasterization .
